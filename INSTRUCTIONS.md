**Title:** Rest-of-Season (ROS) Contact Rate Prediction for MLB Batters  
**Objective:** Build a reproducible workflow to predict ROS contact rate on swings from pitch-level data.  
**Deliverables:** (1) HTML report with data→features→model→calibration→results; (2) runnable code (pipeline + requirements); (3) figures: reliability curve, interval-coverage by sample-size, and one interpretability plot.  
**Constraints:** No team names/logos or proprietary prompts/data. Keep any original PDF private.  
**Ethics:** This is a generalized, team-agnostic brief for portfolio use.
